            <h2>welcome</h2>
            <p>I'm a writer and technologist fascinated by the quiet power of systems change. I've always been inspired by the resilience and adaptability of life â€” like plants growing through sidewalk cracks, solutions emerge in unexpected places.</p>

            <p>I think about opportunities for change as finding the critical moments where timing and conditions align for transformation and new possibilities. Where momentum is building that you can work with rather than against. I feel so drawn to opportunities that live in these spaces where the ingredients for transformation are ripe but it hasn't been realized.</p>

            <p>We continue to live in the most interesting of times. Writing this in August 2025, there's real momentum around removing barriers to building infrastructure, particularly energy and housing. When we achieve abundant clean energy, it unlocks possibilities we haven't fully mapped yet: new modes of production, different patterns of living, technologies that only make sense when power is cheap and clean. I spend much of my time thinking about electrification, grid flexibility, and the practical mechanics of getting energy projects built.</p>

            <p>I'm fundamentally a techno-optimist. I believe in the audacity and resilience of the human spirit, and in technology's ability to expand and magnify human capacity and dreams.</p>

            <div class="work-item">
                <p>At WattTime, I help companies understand and optimize for the real-world emissions consequences of their energy decisions. We build models that predict how power plants respond to changes in load all over the world, enabling companies to shift their energy usage to minimize emissions impact and site new infrastructure where it will be most effective.</p>

                <p>Recently, I've also been doing technical storytelling and content editing for startups, and writing essays on substack about our changing grid and the future of energy tech.</p>

                <p>Previously, I spent four years as a data reporter at the Associated Press, where I built tools to streamline investigative journalism and uncovered climate and energy stories through data analysis and technical methods. I found patterns in wildfire spending, water infrastructure failures, and the human impacts of environmental change.</p>

                <p>My background also includes work as a data science fellow at the Human Rights Data Analysis Group and a Venture Capital Fellow at Third Sphere, where I sourced and conducted diligence for energy and climate startups at the seed and pre-seed stages. I've developed privacy-preserving technology for journalists and whistleblowers, and co-developed an open source database project to track police misconduct in the Bay Area.</p>
