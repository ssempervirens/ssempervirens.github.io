# Camille Fassett

## Who?

Currently, I am a data reporter on the climate and environment team at The Associated Press. I do the data science and analysis work that supports our climate coverage broadly, from disappearing sea ice to wildfires. 

Previously, I was a data science fellow at [Human Rights Data Analysis Group](https://hrdag.org/people/camille-fassett/). Before that, I did digital rights, civil liberties, and whistleblower protection research at Freedom of the Press Foundation. 

I'm based in Seattle, and my interests include forests, cartography, freedom, trail running, and aerial arts.

"Even when the truth isn't hopeful, the telling of it is." â€” Andrea Gibson
